Set of skins specifically for a certain background and setup I use. Customizability coming later.
The desktop in particular also uses Nord windows skin: https://www.deviantart.com/niivu/art/Nord-Windows-10-Theme-837266272 with custom icons for Nexus dock. 
Also use two copies of Yadov by JelleDekkers for the visualizer on the side. Wallpaper is NordPeeks here https://www.deviantart.com/niivu/art/Nord-Wallpaper-Pack-837615309
Music Player only works with Youtube, figure it out yourself for other websites or programs
